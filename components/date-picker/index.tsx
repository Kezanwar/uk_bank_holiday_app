Ported this from NativeWindUI, which is a nice component lib that sits ontop of NativeWind
We're using ReactNativeReusables, which is another component lib that sits ontop of NativeWind
I took NativeWindUIs's DatePicker component, which uses "@react-native-community/datetimepicker" intrernally and their custom components and ported it to use our custom components instead ;)
